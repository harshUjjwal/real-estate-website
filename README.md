# real-estate-website
Project Overview
This project is a modern real estate website built with React and styled using Bootstrap and FontAwesome. The application is structured into several reusable components, each responsible for a specific section or feature of the website. The main goal is to provide users with an intuitive interface to search, explore, and gain insights into real estate properties.
Main Components
Header: Displays the websiteâ€™s navigation and branding.
SearchBar: Allows users to search for properties based on various criteria.
PropertyList: Shows a list of available properties, likely with details such as price, location, and features.
PropertyHighlights: Highlights featured or premium properties to attract user attention.
PopularProperties: Displays properties that are trending or most viewed.
ExclusiveProperties: Showcases exclusive listings that may not be available elsewhere.
ResearchInsights: Provides users with market research, trends, or analytics to help inform their decisions.
AdviceTools: Offers tools or tips for buyers, sellers, or renters, such as calculators or guides.
Footer: Contains contact information, links, and other relevant details.
How It Works
The application is organized into a main layout (App.tsx) that brings together all the components.
Users can search for properties, view different categories of listings, and access research and advice tools.
The UI is responsive and visually appealing, thanks to Bootstrap and FontAwesome integration.
